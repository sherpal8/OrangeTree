	<div><p>A community cooperative with Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM) to create an Asian-based (though, not exclusively) stock library for images, illustrations, cartoons, short videos as well as ready to embed webcodes. We aim to turn rural Changlun into a Regional Creatives Hub, thereby creating healthy competition with companies like Evanto (Melbourne, Australia) and Shutterstock USA (reference: stock exchange index NYSE @ US$48.01 +0.62 (+1.31%) @ 1st June 2018).</p> </div>

	<div><p>All 30,000 stock images will have been taken by the 30,000 students at UUM & released under the Creative Commons CC0 license (Royalty Free), which makes them safe to use without asking for permission or giving credit to the artist - even for commercial purposes. Although, some form of acknowledgement is always nice, even if a small payment to treat the photographer to a coffee.</p></div>


	<div><p>For a small fee, consumers globally can access premium library to enhance their websites, e-comm platforms, as well as their advertising, marketing & sales endeavours. Profits are returned to the photographer to help the rural creatives scene flourish.</p></div>
