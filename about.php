				    <p>OrangeTree Production was established within the heart of Kuala Lumpur back in March 2006. Our mission has been to meet with the needs of broadcasting within Malaysia as well as around the region. We may have started off small, but we have been relentless, always working within the coherence of our team. Every project has been dealt with the utmost priority, designed specifically to be unique, coupled with quality to ensure that specificiations are met with and expectations exceeded.</p>

				    <p>Today, we pride ourselves as being an industrial expert with hundreds of programs to-date, from a variety of genre. We don't just work with broadcasting stations, we thrive with them. We take pride in the formidable business friendships we have fostered over the past decade. We remain determined to further nurture what we have developed with our much-valued clients. We invite you to get to know us, not only the quality of our product, but also to get acquainted with our genuinely approachable personality.</p>

				    <p>We have now become a team of key industry players with a keen interest of sharing the wealth of our collective expertise. In addition, with the help of our in-house Research & Development facility, we have begun to make our presence outside of Malaysia with offices in Singapore, Jakarta and, with a rather healthy sense of optimism, more to come.</p>
